This is an experimental Next.js project aimed at exploring the features provided by Vercel. It allows me to delve into Vercel's capabilities for deployment and hosting, enhancing my understanding of its functionalities and optimizing my Next.js application for seamless deployment and performance.

## Background

This finance app is not solely an expense manager application. Instead, it serves as a helpful tool for users to track and analyze their monthly expenses, including subscriptions, installments, fixed expenses, and more. By providing a comprehensive overview, the app allows users to gain valuable insights into their spending habits at a glance.

This helps users understand their expenses better and make informed decisions about their finances.

## Architecture Explain

This is a full-stack Finance App built with Next.js 13 and powered by the App Router. It leverages NeonDB as a database-as-a-service and utilizes Prisma as the glue between the app and the database.

This comprehensive application combines the power of Next.js for server-side rendering and NeonDB for efficient database management. Prisma acts as the bridge that connects the app with the database, enabling seamless data integration and retrieval. With this technology stack, the Finance App offers a robust and efficient solution for managing financial data and delivering a superior user experience.
